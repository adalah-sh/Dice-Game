      <p class="nh">Score points by rolling the dice. Fist player to 100 wins. If you roll a 1, you lose your turn. If a 6 is
        rolled twice in a row, you lose all your points and your turn. You can keep your current score and pass by
        clicking <em>hold</em>. If you want,
        you can set the winning score to something different in the box.</p>

      <h3 class="nh">Description</h3>
      <p class="nh">Dice game a simple game. Players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as they wish, adding all roll
        results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.</p>

      <h3 class="nh">Gameplay</h3>
      <p class="nh">Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
        If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn. If the player rolls any other
        number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues. If a player chooses to "hold", their
        turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn. The first player to score 30 or more
        points wins.
      </p>

      <h3 class="nh">For example</h3>
      <p class="nh">The first player, Mohammed, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Mohammed could hold and score 5 points, but chooses
        to roll again. Mohammed rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again.
        Mohammed rolls a 1, and must end his turn without scoring. The next player, Fadi, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-5,
        after which she chooses to hold, and adds her turn total of 22 points to her score.
